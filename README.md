# Programming Assignment

In this assignment you will build a simple web application that allows someone to store and display weather information in a database.

The solution should include:

1. A web application that allows a user to store the `time` and `temperature` of a `city`.
2. The application will store the information into a database (eg. SQL-Lite, PostgreSQL or MongoDB) via API call.
3. Once entered the front end should display the `time` `temperature` and `city`. It should always display the most recent `temperature`.

1. Front end web application built in - Vue.js or Nuxt.js or React (Could be SPA or SSR).
2. Backend api - Node.js (preferably in Express and TypeScript)
3. Database - SQL-Lite or PostgreSQL or MongoDB

Your solution should be...

- User friendly
- Responsive
- Have a clean design

The solution should be designed with the following in mind:

- Clean code
- Creative / user-friendly design / styling
- Simplicity
- Ease of deployment

Once completed upload your solution to github. *Note: Please do not submit this as a Pull Request*
